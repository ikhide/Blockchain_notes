ETHEREUM SMART CONTRACT SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

* Prepare for failure

- Pause the contract when things go wrong('circuit breaker')
- Manage the amount of money at risk (rate-limiting, maximum usage)
- Effective path for bug fixes

* Rollout Carefully: Test properly

- Test carefully before deploying, add more tests when new attack points are discovered.
- Bug bounties
- Rollout in phases, with increasing usage and testing in each phase.


* Keep Contracts Simple

- Ensure the contract is simple and small
- Modularize code to keep contracts and function (target pattern)
- Use already existing tools or code 
- prefer clarity to performance
- Only use blockchain when necessary.

* Stay up to date

- Fix bugs as soon as vulnerabilities are discovered
- Update to the latest version of any tool as soon as discovered
- Adopt new security techniques when possible

* Beware of the EVM's Idiosyncrasies

- External contracts that contain malicious code
- public functions can be called by anyone, private data is viewable by everyone.
- Keep costs and gas limit in mind
- timestamps in blockchain can be manipulated
